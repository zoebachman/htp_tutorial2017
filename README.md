# HTP Tutorial 2017 - Generative Weather App
Repo for [HTP Tutorial](http://www.hackthepatriarchybaltimore.com/), Spring 2017

This p5.js sketch is a weather visualizer that uses data pulled from the openweatherAPI.  I like how working with changing data can effect a sketch (see the beautiful [wind map] (http://hint.fm/wind/) visualization). There’s a basic version with two variations so you can play around with the interface, making use of the DOM or separate data files.
## Includes *three* versions of an openweatherAPI controlled drawing:

1. Basic (pre-populated zip code)
2. DOM version (user can enter zip codes and refresh the canvas)
3. Random zip version (uses an extra list of zip codes and randomly chooses one each time it’s refreshed)

Dan Shiffman’s [coding train videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) - great introduction/refresher to working with data in various forms.

Other useful p5.js example code lives at the NYU ITP [Introduction to Computational Media class](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ICM-2015/) repo. 

…I specifically looked at [this sketch](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ICM-2015/blob/master/03_interaction/for_loops5/sketch.js) for inspiration.
