This p5.js sketch is a weather visualizer that uses data pulled from the openweatherAPI.  I like how working with changing data can effect a sketch (see the beautiful [wind map] (http://hint.fm/wind/)visualization).There’s a basic version with two variations so you can play around with the interface, making use of the DOM or separate data files. I made this because

## Includes *three* versions of an openweatherAPI controlled drawing:

1. Basic (pre-populated zip code)
2. DOM version (user can enter zip codes and refresh the canvas)
3. Random zip version (uses an extra list of zip codes and randomly chooses one each time it’s refreshed)

## Sources:
To make this sketch, I relied on the [p5.js reference page](http://p5js.org/reference/), Dan Shiffman’s [coding train videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) - great introduction/refresher to working with data in various forms like API and JSON.

I also looked at example code from my [Introduction to Computational Media class] (https://github.com/ITPNYU/ICM-2015/) at NYU-ITP.

…I specifically looked at [this sketch](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ICM-2015/blob/master/03_interaction/for_loops5/sketch.js) when looking for inspiration
